Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntactic differences:

* React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
* With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.

For example, the HTML:

```html
<button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

is slightly different in React:

```js{1}
<button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button>
```

Another difference is that you cannot return `false` to prevent default behavior in React. You must call `preventDefault` explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default link behavior of opening a new page, you can write:

```html
<a href="#" onclick="console.log('The link was clicked.'); return false">
  Click me
</a>
```

In React, this could instead be:

```js{2-5,8}
function ActionLink() {
  function handleClick(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('The link was clicked.');
  }

  return (
    <a href="#" onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me
    </a>
  );
}
```

Here, `e` is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/), so you don't need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. See the [`SyntheticEvent`](/docs/events.html) reference guide to learn more.

When using React you should generally not need to call `addEventListener` to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered.

Below, you have another example with a State Hook.

```js
function Toggle(props) {
  const [isToggleOn, setIsToggleOn] = useState(true);
  
  function handleClick() {
    setIsToggleOn(!isToggleOn)
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      {isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
    </button>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(
  <Toggle />,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

## Passing Arguments to Event Handlers {#passing-arguments-to-event-handlers}

Inside a loop it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if `id` is the row ID, either of the following would work:

```js
<button onClick={(e) => deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button>
```

The above two lines are equivalent, and use [arrow functions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) and [`Function.prototype.bind`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_objects/Function/bind) respectively.

In both cases, the `e` argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with `bind` any further arguments are automatically forwarded.
